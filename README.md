- 👋 Hi, I’m Philip Kimutai Maina, a Cloud Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya.
- 👀 I’m interested in using the cloud computing and data insights to make the world a better place.
- 🌱 I just got my SAA-C03 certificate and currently learning Linux and Python to improve my knowledge of my coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AWS Cloud projects and some data projects.
- 📫 You can reach me on my email - phlpmn@gmaill.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am currently a working musician and music educator, but was once a Mechanical Engineering graduate and now transitioning back into the STEM field through cloud computing. You can ask me anything about the clarinet and I probably have an answer for you.
